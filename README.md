# Profile Story Mobile Concept
## What is this repo?
Well, I love beautiful UIs, that is a fact. Sometimes I spent too much time on Internet just looking designs, just thinking: "*Wow, it would be so nice to try these UIs, not just seeing them as a concept*"

And well, that is why we are here today. I am trying to recreate beautiful concepts I see on Internet. On each repo I will put a link to the concept creator (or if I have done it by myself, I will tell you).

For example, this concept design was originally created by Khawaja Azwar, I found it here: https://www.xdguru.com/profile-story-mobile-xd/ **I have made it on Android Studio**.

Anyway, for example, this repo is made for Android but I plan to code also web UI concepts, and also some mobile UIs on React.JS and Swift (for iOS).

Since this project is not finished, I am not going to explain how to try it or something, just wait until it is finished!
